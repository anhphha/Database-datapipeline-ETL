    "\n",
    "Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) are a crucial concept in dimension modeling, particularly in the context of data warehousing and business intelligence. SCD deals with how to handle changes to dimension attributes over time, ensuring that historical data remains accurate and available for analysis. There are typically three common types of Slowly Changing Dimensions:"
